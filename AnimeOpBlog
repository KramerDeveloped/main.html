  <p>
    Love is War is an anime series about two members of a highschool student council,
    that secretly like each other but don't want to be the first to come out and say it.
    I love the opening for this season for a few reasons,
    first its a duet which I always love for a romance anime so it fits the theme really well. <br>
    The song itself is pretty funky, with the background having Marvin Gaye vibes which really gets you in the mood for romance and that young love feel.
    The Visuals are fantastic, having the two main characters evading or facing away from each other in every scene as to not give their romantic interest away to one another.
    All the while the side characters are making hearts and acting out various RomCom cliches, showing their interest in each other. If the goal of this Opening theme is
    to get you in the <em>Love is in the air</em> mindset, then it does a great job of it, and that's why its my <strong>Number 5</strong> spot.

 <h3>#4 Skeleton Knight In Another World</h3>
 <div class="container">
  <div class="image"><img src="images/SkeletonKnight.Jpeg" alt="cover art from Skeleton Knight in another world anime"></div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
        An Absolute banger of an Op for an Absolute banger of an Anime. Metal in Japanese music is hard to find, but 
        in an anime about a skeleton man just obliterating any enemy he faces <strong><em>it is a necessity!</em></strong>
        I'll spare you the full summary just to get to the good part, basically dude gets sent to another world as his video game
        character which happens to be a skeleton that is way too OP. This opening music reflects that perfectly, with beautiful vocals from 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtUG2AWn80">Pellek </a>a youtuber who has done many japanese covers for openings that finally got his shot to be the OG for one!. The visuals are 
        basic but awesome just giving you a taste of whats to come with explosions and dragons and bandits getting sliced in half what's not to love?
        That makes it my <strong>Number 4</strong> slot!

 <h3>#3 Love After World Domination</h3>
 <div class="container">
  <div class="image"><img src="images/LoveAfterWorldDom.Jpeg" alt="Cover art from Love after world Domination anime"></div>
  <div class="text">
    Not only is this power rangers, but Power rangers where the main villain and hero are dating! Not to overuse the parallel but the visuals for the theme are also very Power rangers,
    you get each character in and out of costume doing things that make up their character, and a little of the villains too. The music is very catchy, with another of my favorites in romance
    anime being the duet in the openings and it's just as wholesome as the show itself which gets you ready to watch. The quality of the music for the first part of a twelve episode anime is insane, and
    if you look it up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBz3DBKzriY">Youtube</a> the comment section is just as thrown as I am about how this Op is so good, despite the popularity advantage
    of all the other's on this list, this is My<strong> Number 3 </strong>pick!

 <h3>#2 Spy X Family</h3>
 <div class="container">
  <div class="image"><img src="images/Spy-X-Family.jpeg" alt="Cover art for the Spy X Family Anime"></div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
        The world's most suave spy makes a fake family with the world'd most dangerous assassin, their adopted daughter can read minds and their theme is ... <em>Cowboy Bebop?!</em>
        Not really but pretty close, and the music, much like the anime is very confusing and dangerous then turns wholesome as the family all uses each other at first for their own goals
        the poor adopted girl just wants a family and I hope that she will win over her fake parents by the end of the series to stay together.The music being what I can only describe as panic
        jazz, think cowboy bebop again, then turning to an upbeat merry kind of vibe. The background is very old school inspector gadget style with a lot of what seems to be inspiration 
        from western cartoons in art style that switches throughout between classic anime and 90s cartoons. The theme and the actual anime both match in terms of wholesome and they trigger
         some nostalgia which is why it takes my <strong>Number Two</strong> spot!

 <h3>#1 Ya boy Kongming</h3>
 <div class="container">
  <div class="image"><img src="images/YaBoyKongming.jpeg" alt="Cover art for Ya Boy Kongming"></div>
  <div class="text">
   <p>
       Eurobeat in 2022, yep and it fits the theme of the show because neither makes any logical sense but its a Bop anyways. The anime is about ancient military strategist Kongming 
       getting transported to our time, and basically helps a girl become hannah montana?? Whoever came up with the concept was on some different kind of stuff, but it doesn't change the
       fact that the song slaps and the show is a great watch so far too. This song has been stuck in my head for the past week and I literally can't stop humming it, the background visuals
       are all characters doing a fusion of old martial arts dance moves in a 90's <em><strong>Initial D</strong></em> themed city with bright colors. Overall this theme is a Drug and I am addicted.
       That is why without a doubt my number One Opening theme of Spring 2022 goes to <strong><em>Ya Boy Kongming!</em></strong>
